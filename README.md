# Emotion-AI-Facial-Key-points-Detection

In this project I have created a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Network and Residual Blocks to predict facial key-points.

Facial Key-Point detection serves as a basis for Emotional AI applications like detecting customer emotional responses to Ads and Driver Monitoring Systems.


The KeyFacialPoints.csv file and weights.hdf5 need to be downloaded separately due to their large size and github size restrictions.
They can be found at following endpoints:
